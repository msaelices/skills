# Modular Skills

These are the official AI agent skills from [Modular](https://www.modular.com/)
that encapsulate modern best-practices for working with the Modular Platform,
including MAX🧑‍🚀 and Mojo🔥. They allow any AI coding agent to become fluent in
developing new Mojo projects and more.

The skills are structured to follow the
[Agent Skills Standard](https://agentskills.io/specification).

## Installation

### Installing via `npx`

With [node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download), you can install all
skills using a single command:

```bash
npx skills add modular/skills
```

Individual skills can also be installed in isolation:

```bash
npx skills add modular/skills --skill new-modular-project
```

This will install the latest version of the Modular skills into the appropriate
location for your AI coding agent. These skills will be updated to the latest
version on a global skill update:

```bash
npx skills update
```

### Manual installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modular/skills.git
```

and then copy or symbolically link the individual skills into the relevant
location in your AI coding agent's configuration directory. For Claude Code,
that would be `~/.claude/skills/`. Refer to your specific agent's documentation
for where this lives.

## Skills

### `new-modular-project`

[This skill](new-modular-project/SKILL.md) provides a wizard-like experience
for creating a new MAX or Mojo project, letting your AI agent install the right
tools and modules you need to get started. This is triggered on asking your
agent to help you begin a new Mojo or MAX project. You can either provide all
the needed details upfront for such a project (working against nightly or
stable, what package manager to use, etc.) or your agent will prompt you for
any missing information.

### `mojo-syntax`

[This skill](mojo-syntax/SKILL.md) adjusts the pretrained behavior of many
coding models around generating Mojo code to overcome incorrect assumptions and
allow them to generate correct modern Mojo syntax. This skill should be hooked
in whenever an agent is writing Mojo code.

### `mojo-gpu-fundamentals`

[This skill](mojo-gpu-fundamentals/SKILL.md) builds upon the fundamentals in
`mojo-syntax` and makes sure that the correct modern patterns for programming
GPUs using Mojo are followed. It is activated when Mojo code targeting an
accelerator is being generated. This skill does not go into
architecture-specific optimizations, but covers general patterns of how GPUs
are programmed using Mojo.

### `mojo-python-interop`

[This skill](mojo-python-interop/SKILL.md) pairs with `mojo-syntax` to handle
cases where either Mojo works with Python or Python calls into Mojo. It is
triggered when Python types are used Mojo or a Python module needs to interact
with Mojo code. Many capabilities of Mojo - Python interoperability are fairly
new, and existing coding agents don't handle them correctly without guidance.

### `import-model`

[This skill](import-model/SKILL.md) walks an AI agent through importing a
new model architecture into MAX, starting from a Hugging Face model ID. It's
triggered when you ask your agent to import a model into MAX, add a model to
MAX, or bring up a Hugging Face model in MAX. The skill drives a three-phase
workflow (decide and plan, implement, verify) that scaffolds from a similar
registered MAX architecture, implements every divergent layer against the
Hugging Face reference, and verifies outputs match before declaring the
import done.

When the server runs but generated text is wrong (gibberish, greedy token
mismatch, or coherent-then-diverges), `import-model` hands off to
`debug-model` for the divergence hunt.

### `debug-model`

[This skill](debug-model/SKILL.md) debugs silent corruption when a
MAX model loads, compiles, serves, and generates tokens, but output disagrees
with a reference implementation — during an architecture port, a quantization
bring-up, a multi-GPU conversion, or after a MAX upgrade. Use it when parity
debugging stalls on scalar taps or you see gibberish, greedy token mismatch,
or coherent-then-diverges behavior. Not for crashes on load or pre-serve
scaffolding.

The protocol builds HF vs MAX tensor-dump comparators first, verifies fixes
numerically before recompiling, and bisects serve vs pipeline when dumps match
but text diverges. Pair with `import-model`: scaffold and implement there,
invoke `debug-model` when verification fails on output quality.

### `mojo-optimizations`

[This skill](mojo-optimizations/SKILL.md) captures performance optimization
patterns for Mojo. It layers on top of `mojo-syntax` and is triggered when
profiling, benchmarking, tuning latency, or porting performance-sensitive code
to Mojo. It covers hot-path inlining, pre-allocation, unsafe pointer access in
hot loops, struct layout, view-vs-owned types, lazy-initialized global caches,
hash-keyed caching, `comptime` specialization, nibble-based SIMD byte scanning,
prefiltering strategies, and fast-path dispatch.

### `mojo-stdlib-contributing`

[This skill](mojo-stdlib-contributing/SKILL.md) captures patterns and pitfalls
for contributing to the Mojo standard library, distilled from 30+ reviewed PRs.
It covers process (GitHub issues before new APIs, draft PRs), assertion
semantics (`assert_mode="safe"` is intentional), benchmark patterns, testing
requirements, SIMD/memory safety, and common reviewer feedback. Use when
modifying code under `mojo/stdlib/`.

### `mojo-stdlib-review`

[This skill](mojo-stdlib-review/SKILL.md) performs an adversarial (red-team)
review of one or more Mojo stdlib PRs. It spawns parallel agents that
fact-check every claim in the diff against the actual stdlib source and the
rules in `mojo-stdlib-contributing`, classify findings (Critical / Factual /
Completeness / Inconsistency / Question / Minor), and write a local findings
file for the author to fix before flipping a draft PR to ready-for-review.
Pass `"in post mode"` in the arguments to post review comments on the PR via
`gh pr review` instead. Use when you want a thorough self-review pass on a
stdlib contribution, or to fact-check someone else's stdlib PR.

## Examples

Once these skills are installed, you can use them for many common tasks.
Examples include:

### Starting a new Mojo project

```text
I'd like to create a new Mojo project named "my-cool-library".
```

### Translating CUDA C++ code to Mojo

```text
A CUDA kernel is present in `../example`, please create a new Mojo project that implements that same kernel.
```

For several of these skills, your AI agent may prompt you for more information
to clarify your objectives and to make sure the right tools and patterns are
used.
